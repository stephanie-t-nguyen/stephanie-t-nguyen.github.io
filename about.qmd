\~more about me outside of my career goals\~

### Hello!

I am a current UCSB Environmental Studies and Biological Sciences double major. I work as both as chemistry tutor and peer mentor at UCSB's first-gen student center.

### Cooking

Cooking is one of my favorite pass times. Food is not just a means of living, but it is integral to cultural, community, and relationships. I'm always looking to improve my cooking skills, but here are some of the dishes I am proudest of.
