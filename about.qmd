\~more about me outside of my career goals\~

### Identity

I am a proud first-generation, Vietnamese-American college graduate.

### Cooking

Cooking is one of my favorite pass times. Food is not just a means of living, but it is integral to cultural, community, and relationships. Here are my proudest dishes I have made so far.

### Games

I love all types of games - video games, board games, and sports!
